metaDescription: 'In the Prisma Data Platform, you can create projects from your JavaScript/TypeScript database applications that use Prisma. To do so, you need to have your database connection string at hand and configure access to the database from the Prisma Data Platform static IPs as well as select a Data Proxy region.'

In the Prisma Data Platform, you can create new projects only with an available database connection string. When you create a project, you can also configure access to the database with [static IPs](/data-platform/static-ips) and select a [Data Proxy](/data-platform/data-proxy) region.

After you create your project, you can optionally link your Prisma schema (if you push it to a GitHub repository) so that we can constantly synchronize your project with its latest version and enable you and your team members to work with the Data Browser, Query Console, and Schema Viewer.

To enable connection pooling and load balancing of database connections with the Data Proxy for your project, you can create a Data Proxy connection string at the end of the process.

## Create a project

When you create a project, you only need to provide a database connection string, select a Data Proxy region for the project, and enable static IPs in case your database is behind a firewall and can accept incoming connections only from pre-configured IPs.

### Prerequisites

Copy the database connection string for your project.

* The database must be a [Prisma ORM-supported database](/reference/database-reference/supported-databases).
* Use the connection string format below.<br /s>
   `<database-type>://<user>:<password>@<database-hostname>:<port>/<database-name>`
    * The connection string must include `user` and `password`
    * During project creation, Prisma Data Platform uses the connection string only to read and introspect the database.

### Steps

1. After you [sign up for the Prisma Data Platform](/data-platform/account#sign-up-for-the-prisma-data-platform), go to the [_Projects_](https://cloud.prisma.io/projects) page.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. In **Connection string**, paste the database connection string for your project.
4. (Optional) From **Static IPs**, select **Enabled** if your database is behind a firewall and you can only configure external access from specific IP addresses. Copy the IP addresses and add them to the allowlist of your database.

    For more information, see [Static egress IP address](/data-platform/static-ips).

5. From **Choose a Data Proxy region**, select the geographic location for the Data Proxy.
    <Admonition>
    
    **Note**<br /><br />
    Select a Data Proxy location that is close to the geographic location of your database.<br /><br />
    If you select a location that is remote from your database, then when your application sends requests to your database through the Data Proxy, you might notice some delay in the responses.
    </Admonition>
6. Click **Create project**.

### Result

Prisma Data Platform introspects the database to read the data models so that it can generate the Prisma schema. 

If your database is empty, 

### What's next

* You can view the introspected Prisma schema in the [Schema Viewer](/data-platform/schema-viewer).
* Based on the Prisma schema, you can edit your data in the [Data Browser](/data-platform/data-browser).
* Also based on the Prisma schema, you can use your data model to query your database with the [Query Console](/data-platform/query-console).

## (Optional) Enable schema synchronization

After you create the project, you can enable automated schema synchronization. This means that if you push your Prisma schema to a GitHub repository, you can link the Prisma schema and the GitHub repository in your project. As a result, Prisma Data Platform will automatically update the Prisma schema for your project and keep your work in Data Browser and Query Console up-to-date with its latest version.

### Steps

1. On the **Get started** screen, from **GitHub Accounts & Organizations**, select a GitHub account or an organization.
2. From **Repository**, select the GitHub repository you want to import.
3. From **Branch**, select the branch you want to import.
4. In **Prisma Schema path**, enter the path to the `schema.prisma` file.

    **Note**<br /><br />

    The pre-filled path `prisma/schema.prisma` is the default path. Change it to the path you use for your project.
    </Admonition>
7. Click **Link repository**.<br />
**Step result:** The repository and the Prisma schema are now linked to your project.

## (Optional) Create Data Proxy connection string

After you create the project, you can optionally copy a Data Proxy connection string which you can then use with Prisma Client to enable connection pooling and load balancing of database connections locally or in your deployment environment.

### Steps

1. Click **Generate a Data Proxy connection string**.
2. Click **Create a new connection string**.
3. Enter a name for the connection string and click **Create**.
4. Copy the `prisma://` connection string.
