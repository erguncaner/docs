metaDescription: 'In the Prisma Data Platform, you can create projects from your JavaScript/TypeScript database applications that use Prisma. To do so, you need to have your database connection string at hand and configure access to the database from the Prisma Data Platform static IPs as well as select a Data Proxy region.'

<TopBlock>

In the Prisma Data Platform, you can create new projects only with an available database connection string. You can also configure access to the database with [static IPs](/data-platform/static-ips) and select a [Data Proxy](/data-platform/data-proxy) region.

</TopBlock>

## Prerequisites and considerations

Copy the database connection string for your project. The database must be a [Prisma ORM-supported database](/reference/database-reference/supported-databases).

## Steps

1. After you [sign up for the Prisma Data Platform](/data-platform/account#sign-up-for-the-prisma-data-platform), go to the [_Projects_](https://cloud.prisma.io/projects) page.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. In **Connection string**, paste the database connection string for your project.
4. (Optional) From **Static IPs**, select **Enabled** if your database is behind a firewall and you can only configure external access from specific IP addresses. Copy the IP addresses and add them to the allowlist of your database.

    For more information, see [Static egress IP address](/data-platform/static-ips).

5. From **Choose a Data Proxy region**, select the geographic location for the Data Proxy.
    <Admonition>
    
    **Note**<br /><br />
    Select a Data Proxy location that is close to the geographic location of your database.<br /><br />
    If you select a location that is remote from your database, then when your application sends requests to your database through the Data Proxy, you might notice some delay in the responses.
    </Admonition>
6. Click **Create project**.

## Result

## What's next

You can now further [configure your project](/data-platform/projects/configure) when you link the Prisma schema which needs to be in a GitHub repository and create a Data Proxy connection string.
